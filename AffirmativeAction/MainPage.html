  <h1>Affirmative Action</h1>
  <p><b>A Defitiniton of Affirmative action</b> is “a set of procedures designed to; eliminate unlawful discrimination among applicants, remedy the results of such prior discrimination and prevent such discrimination in the future.” (Cornell Law)  The policy was introduced to the United States through executive orders by Presidents John F Kennedy and Lyndon B Johnson. While affirmative action has been implemented nationally, its fairness and effectiveness have been the subjects of numerous debates and legal challenges.</p>
  <p><b>College recuitment</b> has become much more competitive over the years, leading to even more obsticles, bias, and dicrimantion from higher education. Affirmative actions was implemented in the college acceptance process to address the underrepresentation of minority students. These policies aimed to increase diversity and provide equal opportunities for historically marginalized groups. In 1978, the landmark Supreme Court case University of California v. Bakke ruled that strict racial quotas were unconstitutional, but allowed the consideration of race as one factor amongst many in admission decisions. This in turn set the stage for the use of affirmative action in college admissions and institutions adopted various approaches to achieve diversity. </p>
  <p>After President Kennedy first introduced the term “affirmative action” in 1961 through an executive order that aimed to ensure equal employment opportunities for marginalized groups, President Johnson expanded on it in 1965. Johnson signed another executive order that required government contractors to take steps to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices. Since then, affirmative action in hiring has included measures like targeted recruitment and diversity initiatives.</p>
