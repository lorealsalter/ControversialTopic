  <h1>Cons of Affirmative Action</h1>
  <h2>Creates tokenism</h2>  
  <li>Affirmative action can result in tokenism, where minorities are seen as symbols of diversity rather than being valued for their individual talents and contributions.</li>
  <h2>Creates resentment and backlash from majority communities</h2>
  <li>Affirmative action can foster resentment amongst the majority group who may view it as preferential treatment and feel that they are treated unfairly.</li>
  <h2>Contributes to stigmas and stereotypes.</h2>
  <li>Affirmative Action can create doubt about the achievements from those who benefit from it. It can undermine the accomplishments of those who are beneficiaries of affirmative action because their success may be attributed solely to their race or gender and undermines their abilities and qualifications.</li>
